# Code Review

Code review written by [Jennifer Andersson](https://github.com/JennAnd).

1. When I pressed the link “Vegetables & Fruits” and “See all of the fruits & vegetables!”, some of them you can view more than one time, for example Brussel sprouts I could see three times on the page.
2. The text in Green Kale, apricot & Jerusalem artichoke is floating outside the box. 
3. When I pressed “See what’s in season for November” link I came to a view of all fruits and vegetables and not the specific ones for November.
4. Info-, index- och content.php-files is outside the PHP-folder and the other PHP-files is inside the folder.
5. Maybe you could have written your own comments so its easier to see what the page includes.
6. You could have tried to make functions for your foreach-loops.
